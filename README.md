## Element Blaster
Element Blaster is a game in which a player is represented as an ordinary blob in our three-dimensional world. However, in the two-dimensional world, you are no longer just a blob. You are reborn into a warrior fighting for survival as other elements try to take everything you know and love, your little blobs.

This game is hugely inspired by the simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where every single element in the game overcomes the other and vice-versa. It is bias towards those with quicker reflexes.

The elements in this game is not rock nor paper nor scissor, but of the classical elements: fire, water, lightning, and earth.

Blast through your enemies as you are playing rounds upon rounds of rapid rock-paper-scissors. Players must be able to quickly identify the classical element that is being thrown at them. Responding correctly will overcome but one wrong move and it's one step closer to implosion.
